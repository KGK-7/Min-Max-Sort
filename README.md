echo "## Introduction"
echo "# Min-Max Sort is an optimized version of Selection Sort that improves efficiency"
echo "# by sorting both ends of the array simultaneously. This implementation is available"
echo "# in Java and Python."
echo ""
echo "## 📌 How It Works?"
echo "# 1️⃣ Identify the minimum and maximum elements in the array in a single iteration."
echo "# 2️⃣ Swap the minimum with the leftmost element and the maximum with the rightmost."
echo "# 3️⃣ Shrink the search space by incrementing 'left' and decrementing 'right' after each iteration."
echo "# 4️⃣ Repeat until the array is fully sorted."
echo "# This approach reduces the number of passes, making it nearly twice as fast as Selection Sort!"

echo "## 📊 Comparison with Selection Sort"
echo "# | Sorting Algorithm  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Key Difference |"
echo "# |--------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|"
echo "# | Selection Sort    | O(n²)          | O(1)            | Finds only min in each pass |"
echo "# | Min-Max Sort     | O(n²)          | O(1)            | Finds both min & max in each pass |"
echo "#"
echo "# 🔹 Both have O(n²) worst-case complexity, but Min-Max Sort reduces iterations and comparisons, improving practical performance."
